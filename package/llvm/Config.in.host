		The llvm-tblgen tool is needed when cross-compiling LLVM for the
		target. If LLVM is not needed by any host tools, if it possible to
		select this option to speed up the build.

		NOTE: Normally LLVM builds a native llvm-tblgen as part of the normal
		build procedure. Using this option should not be normally needed, use
		it only if you know what you are doing!
